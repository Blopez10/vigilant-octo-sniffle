MipScope is a cross-platform Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for
students learning MIPS r3000 / MIPS32 assembly programming. It features an
editor with an integrated MIPS interpreter and debugger. The focus is on
helping beginners write and debug meaningful programs quickly.

MipScope was designed to replace the SPIM simulator in Brown University's
Introduction to Computer Systems course. MipScope implements most of the
r3000 and MIPS32 specifications. Floating point operations, exceptions, and
self-modifying code aren't supported at this time.
