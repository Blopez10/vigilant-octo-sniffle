- Still need to look through the source code and verify that
  there's no more scripts that need their hashbangs replaced.

- The build system has went through a fairly big revamp, so we
  should check if `MAKE_JOBS_SAFE=no' still applies.

- The project's official homepage has pretty much moved to
  GitHub, so we should investigate whether which HOMEPAGE
  to use.

- Needs a LICENSE. Not sure which to use since the authors seem
  to be using a custom one.
