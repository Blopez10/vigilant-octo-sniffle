Osmose uses Linux-only libraries for dealing with sound and
joystick input, so they've been gutted so that Osmose can at
least compile and run.

The Preferences screen also seems to be broken, and the File
Select window acts a bit funny too.

At the very least, ROMs seem to load and run fine, as well as
as the rest of the UI controls. Not seeing any performance issues.
