FCGI::Daemon is a small FastCGI server for use as CGI-wrapper for
CGI applications.

Like mod_perl FCGI-Daemon stay persistent in memory and accelerate
unmodified CGI applications written in Perl.

FCGI-Daemon run CGI scripts with RLIMITs and predefined number of
workers.

It was developed as replacement for cgiwrap-fcgi.pl
(http://wiki.nginx.org/SimpleCGI) and fcgiwrap
(http://nginx.localdomain.pl/wiki/FcgiWrap).

FCGI-Daemon check for executable in path and correctly set PATH_INFO
environment variable which is crucial for some CGI applications
like fossil (http://fossil-scm.org). (Lack of this functionality
make cgiwrap-fcgi.pl unsuitable for some scripts.)
