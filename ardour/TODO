- Need to figure out why jack with OSS fails to autostart when a new
project is created.

Currently you need to use the "Dummy" driver initially then switch
to OSS once the project is created.

It may be a race condition.

- Also, probably a good idea to get jack's sun driver working on NetBSD.

- Install config files "the pkgsrc way".
