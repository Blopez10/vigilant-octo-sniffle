This is a simple script for generating GDSII layout files from image
files. The input image files should have the extensions jpeg, jpg, png,
pbm, pgm, or bmp. By specifying an image file, size of the unit-cell
(minimum width and space of the layout), and layer number of the GDSII
file, you can get a binary image file (image.bmp) and a GDSII layout file
(image.gds).
