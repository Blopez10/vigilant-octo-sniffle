q is a command line tool that allows direct execution of SQL-like
queries on CSVs/TSVs (and any other tabular text files).

q treats ordinary files as database tables, and supports all SQL
constructs, such as WHERE, GROUP BY, JOINs etc. It supports automatic
column name and column type detection, and provides full support
for multiple encodings.
