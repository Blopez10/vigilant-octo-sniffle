This is a GPL release of the Seven Kingdoms: Ancient Adversaries thanks to
Enlight Software which granted the ability to license the game under a
free and open source license in 2009. See the file "COPYING" for the
details of the license. We are indebted to Enlight for making the 7kfans
project possible and giving a new chance to build a community for fans
of the game.

This package contains the non-GPL music files, which are redistributed
separately due to restrictive licensing. Their license forbids modifications
and they are restricted for use with Seven Kingdoms alone.

Once installed, these will automatically be used by 7kaa.
