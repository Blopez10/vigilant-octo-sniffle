DXX-Rebirth is a Source Port of the Descent and Descent 2 Engines
for Windows, Mac OS, Linux (most *NIX systems), offering OpenGL
graphics and effects, advanced Multiplayer, many improvements and
new features.

Descent and Descent 2 are pretty old games so you usually run into
problems running it on more recent Hardware and Operating Systems.
DXX-Rebirth will also take care about this for you.

This is the Descent source port. The data files are not included.
