PyDy, short for Python Dynamics, is a tool kit written in the Python
programming language that utilizes an array of scientific programs to
enable the study of multibody dynamics. The goal is to have a modular
framework and eventually a physics abstraction layer which utilizes a
variety of backends that can provide the user with their desired
workflow, including:

- Model specification
- Equation of motion generation
- Simulation
- Visualization
- Publication

We started by building the SymPy mechanics package which provides an API
for building models and generating the symbolic equations of motion for
complex multibody systems
