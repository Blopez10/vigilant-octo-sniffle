FrobTADS has been written as a replacement for the "traditional"
Unix-port of TADS, which has many problems and limitations, and is
difficult to maintain and change.  The FrobTADS interpreter also
provides some features that the traditional Unix-port lacks, the most
important of them being:

  - Automatic configuration prior to building; no need to edit
    makefiles.
  - TADS 3 color support and configurable default colors.
  - Correct timing with timed operations (millisecond-precision).
  - Input like in Frotz; cursor keys, insert, delete, etc., instead
    of Emacs-like input.
  - TADS 3 banners look as they should.
  - You are not required to install the package prior to running the
    TADS 3 test suite.
  - File I/O initiated by the game will happen in the game's directory.
    This means that you don't have to change to the game's directory
    prior to starting the interpreter.
  - Less source code (and also less complex), more comments.
  - More portable.

The ultimate goal is to make FrobTADS compile and run out-of-the-box on
every system that has a curses library and a Unix-like shell available.
