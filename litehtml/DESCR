litehtml is the lightweight HTML rendering engine with CSS2/CSS3
support. Note, litehtml itself does not draw any text, pictures or
other graphics and litehtml does not depend of any image/draw/font
library. You are free to use any library to draw images, fonts and
any other graphics. litehtml just parses HTML/CSS and places the
HTML elements into right position (renders HTML). To draw the html
elemens you have to implement the simple callback interface
document_container.
