Lumberjack is a Go package for writing logs to rolling files.

Lumberjack is intended to be one part of a logging infrastructure.
It is not an all-in-one solution, but instead is a pluggable
component at the bottom of the logging stack that simply controls the files
to which logs are written.

Lumberjack plays well with any logging package that can write to an
io.Writer, including the standard library's log package.

Lumberjack assumes that only one process is writing to the output files.
Using the same lumberjack configuration from multiple processes on the same
machine will result in improper behavior.
