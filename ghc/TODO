* Build more bootstrapping compilers to support more platforms.

How to build a bootstrapping compiler
-------------------------------------

You need a working compiler to build one. If you think there are no
bindists for your platform, you may need to cross-build a compiler
yourself: `Cross-compiling GHC
<http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/Building/CrossCompiling>`_

Assuming you have a working ghc in your PATH, just run ``bmake patch
&& bmake bootstrap`` and see if you are lucky enough.
