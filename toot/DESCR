toot is a command line microblogging client for interacting with Mastodon
instances on the distributed social network known as the 'Fediverse'.

It supports regular and two-factor authentication, and has commands for
showing an account's timeline, searching, posting 'toots' (messages),
uploading images or video files, and following and unfollowing, muting
and unmuting, and blocking and unblocking accounts.
