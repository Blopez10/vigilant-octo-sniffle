Need to write NetBSD joystick code based on FreeBSD code.
FreeBSD code seems strange - it may not match current FreeBSD?
- some of the prototypes seem to have changed in FreeBSD

We don't have hid_get_report_id.
hid reportid seems to be set by calling hid_start_parse(.., .., id);
(what is the utility of setting an id? what should it be?)

(relevant info in /usr/src/lib/libusbhid and man 3 usbhid.
games/rocksndiamonds seems to have a joystick implementation that
may be referenced.)
