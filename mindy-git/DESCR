Mindy is an implementation of a language that is very much like the language
described in the Dylan Reference Manual (DRM). Mindy was named for "Mindy Is
Not Dylan Yet", and it still is and will probably always remain a Dylan subset,
primarily because mindycomp t do enough semantic analysis to implement macros
or to implement the precise semantics of Dylan naming.
